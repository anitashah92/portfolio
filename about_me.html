		        <p> Hi there. My name is Anita and I’m 25 years old, a certified yoga teacher, bollywood fanatic, amataur chef, and above all, a user experience designer. </p>
            <p> But let’s start at the beginning. </p>
            <p> Since I was a child, I was a people person. I wanted to always be around different types of people, and I loved observing people’s habits and motivations. </p>
            <p> Fast forward years later, I had to decide my university degree. I decided to get my Bachelors in Psychology. And I loved it! It fascinated me to take a step up from observing people, to understanding the decisions and choices they make. But then I graduated and the common millenial question hit me. Now what? Should I pursue my Ph.D? Should I enter H.R.? Neither of those options felt like the right fit for how I wanted to use this education. I knew I wasn’t going to be passionate about that work. </p>
            <p> While figuring out my next steps, I received a wonderful opportunity to teach English abroad in rural India. The experience was life-changing. I was able to spend time with kids who lived in poverty, but they still were able to enjoy every moment of their life with nothing.  Traveling through rural India, opened my eyes to a different culture and a different way of thinking. I knew that whatever career choice I would choose in the end, I would want to make a substantial impact on others. After volunteering, I decided to stay back in India and become a certified yoga teacher! </p>
            <p> During my time in India, I decided to enroll in a few online courses focused on web design.  (My sister is a software engineer an encouraged me to follow her path). Along with the courses, I started experimenting with Illustrator and Sketch, teaching myself design and front-end skills.  I could  see web design as a career option,  but I knew that I didn’t want to be stuck behind a laptop, staring at a screen, having no other human interaction. </p>
            <p> After coming back to the states,  my sister introduced me to  UX design as she felt that would fit what I was looking for.  My constant curiosity at people’s behaviors, my background in psychology, and now my web design skills could come together into one dream job. And thus began my journey into becoming an UX designer. </p>
